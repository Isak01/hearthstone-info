          <h2>Matches</h2>
          <p>Each Hearthstone match is a 1vs1 battle between two opponents. Gameplay in Hearthstone is turn-based, with
            players taking turns to play cards from their hand to cast powerful spells, equip mighty weapons, or summon
            vicious minions to do battle on their behalf. The game may be played between two human players, or one human
            and an AI computer opponent.</p>
          <p>Each player is represented by their chosen 'hero', an important character from Warcraft lore. Each hero is
            associated with a particular class, which determines the special cards and unique hero power available to
            them. Each hero has 30 Health, and if their Health is reduced to zero, the hero is destroyed and the
            controlling player loses the game.</p>
          <p>At the start of each turn, the player draws a new card from their deck - a collection of 30 cards selected
            before battle. Players can choose to play using one of several pre-assembled 'basic' decks, or one of their
            own custom-made decks. While most cards are available to heroes of any class (neutral cards), a substantial
            portion of them are limited to a specific class, giving each hero their own strengths and unique
            abilities.</p>
          <p>During their turn, each player can choose to play any of their cards, use their Hero Power, command their
            minions to attack targets, or even have their hero attack directly if they have a weapon equipped. However,
            most actions require the player to spend mana, and this limitation forces players to strategically plan out
            their moves. Each player starts the game with 1 Mana Crystal, and gains one more at the start of each turn
            until they reach the maximum of 10 Mana Crystals. All of a player's mana regenerates at the beginning of
            their turn (all their Mana Crystals become 'filled'). Unspent mana remaining at the end of the turn does not
            carry over to the next. The larger mana pools in later rounds allow players to play increasingly expensive
            cards, opening the game up to more impressive moves and powerful abilities.</p>
          <p>In theory the objective of a game of Hearthstone is simple: reduce the enemy hero's health to zero before
            they can do so to you. However, the game features multiple strategic elements which require mastery before
            one can be successful at competitive levels of play. The control of minions, the assignment of strategic
            importance to various targets, complex card synergies and interactions, as well as the unpredictability of
            the randomly selected cards drawn each round, combine to create a complex game where the best plays are not
            always obvious.</p>
          <p>Completing a match will grant each player's hero experience, slowly increasing their level, and granting
            them access to extra cards. While concluding a match will reward both players with experience, winning
            matches offers additional rewards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Battlefields</h2>
          <p>Each match takes place on a randomly selected battlefield, representing the board on which the game is
            played. There are numerous possible battlefields, each depicting a particular zone or city within the
            Hearthstone universe. Each battlefield features its own design and numerous interactive elements, but play
            is in no way affected or determined by battlefield selection. Around the battlefield are various important
            UI elements, such as each player's hand, deck and Mana Crystals, as well as the two heroes themselves.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="tutorial-section">
        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Order Of Play</h2>
          <p>At the start of each match, a coin is tossed to decide which player will go first. Each player is then
            shown 3 random cards from their own deck (4 cards for the player going second) which they can either keep or
            replace individually. Random cards from the deck will be selected to replace those cards that the player
            discarded, and the discarded cards are reshuffled back into the deck. The player that goes second also
            receives a special card on their first turn called "The Coin" that can be used at any time to grant the
            player one extra full Mana Crystal until the end of the turn it is played on. For more details on the card
            selection stage, see Mulligan.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="half-border">A 2 mana cost minion with 2 Attack and 3 Health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <p>At the start of each turn, all of the player's Mana Crystals are refilled and one card is drawn from their
            deck and added to their hand. Players can have a maximum of 10 Mana Crystals, and every turn, if the player
            has less than 10 at the start of the turn, they will receive a new filled one. Players can also only have up
            to 10 cards maximum in their hand; attempting to draw a card with a full hand will cause this new card to be
            revealed to both players and be immediately destroyed.</p>
          <p>During your turn you can play any of your cards, including summoning minions, casting spells and equipping
            weapons, provided you have enough mana. Playing a card will consume the amount of mana stated in the
            top-left corner of the card. You are also able to command your minions to attack, use your hero's Hero
            Power, or even use your hero to attack targets directly if your hero has an Attack value this turn (usually
            granted by having a weapon equipped). Any cards, your Hero Power, or minions that you are currently able to
            play or command, are illuminated with a bright green aura.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The match will go on until one of the following goals is achieved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the players' heroes reaches zero Health (or below) and is destroyed. The remaining player wins.
            </li>
            <li>Alternatively, if a hero has become Lord Jaraxxus, a card called Sacrificial Pact can destroy him.</li>
            <li>Uther of the Ebon Blade can summon The Four Horsemen (Hero Power) minions, four of which destroy the
              opponent ending the game.
            </li>
            <li>A player concedes (see below) or leaves the game. The remaining player wins.</li>
            <li>Both heroes' health reaches zero at the same time. This causes a draw, although both players will see
              the Defeat screen. Neither player will win or lose a star in Ranked play, and neither player will be
              awarded a win or loss in Arena mode. If you were on a winning streak, it will end your streak.
            </li>
            <li>At the beginning of the 90th turn (round 44.5), the game will end in a draw although both players will
              see the Defeat screen.[5] This means that Player 1 has 45 complete turns (turn 1, 3, 5... 87, 89), while
              Player 2 has 44 complete turns (turn 2, 4, 6... 86, 88). Player 2 does not start turn 90, will not draw a
              card and any start of turn triggers will not happen. This bypasses Immune.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Conceding</h3>
          <p>Players often choose to concede or forfeit the match once they realize they cannot avoid defeat, and can do
            so at any time through the Game Menu, accessed through the cog-wheel icon in the bottom-right corner of the
            screen. Conceding can save time spent playing out the final inevitable events of the match, or be used at a
            far earlier stage in order to avoid wasting time in a match the player feels they cannot win. In some cases,
            players will concede due to having made a critical error, following which they cannot bring themselves to
            continue the match.</p>

        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Cards</h2>
          <p>Players can initially choose from a selection of more than 130 cards, with 1316 cards available in total
            for players to collect, from a variety of card sets. New cards can be earned in several ways: through
            increasing the level of their heroes, winning them as prizes in the Arena, purchasing them from the store
            (using either real money or gold, an in-game currency), earning ranks in Ranked play, or from completing
            single-player adventures. Cards may be gained individually or in packs of 5.</p>
          <p>Players can browse their cards in the Collection screen, and create custom decks to play with. The
            selection of cards for a deck is a substantial part of the strategic play of Hearthstone, with each deck's
            30-card limit forcing players to make tough decisions and focus on their chosen strategy. Players can also
            disenchant unwanted cards to acquire Arcane Dust, a resource which can be used to craft powerful new
            cards.</p>
          <p>Each card also comes in a golden form. Golden cards offer no gameplay advantage over non-golden cards, but
            feature special graphics and animations, bringing each card's art to life. Golden cards serve as prestige
            items, and are more expensive to craft than other cards.</p>

          <h2>Game Modes</h2>
          <p>Hearthstone offers several different game modes in which to do battle.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tutorial mode includes the first several introductory missions that new players will encounter upon
              opening Hearthstone for the first time. These feature an introductory and non-repeatable starting
              experience designed to introduce new players to Hearthstone.
            </li>
            <li>In Practice mode, players can play against a selection of computer opponents. Players can learn the
              basics of the game battling against 'basic' opponents, or can put their skills to the test against
              improved 'expert' opponents.
            </li>
            <li>Play mode matches players against other human players of similar skill, in random matches. Players can
              choose to play Casual 'friendly' games, or take part in Ranked play, earning ranks and special rewards to
              reflect their skill and standing within the community.
            </li>
            <li>The Arena offers a unique challenge, with players forging a new deck from a random selection of cards
              before using it to do battle in a series of games. Doing well in Arena can grant substantial rewards
              consisting of gold, dust, cards and card packs, but each admission costs 150 gold or real money.
            </li>
            <li>Tavern Brawl is a weekly game mode, with a new Tavern Brawl available each week. Each Tavern Brawl
              presents a limited time opportunity to face other players in special matches with unique rules. These
              might be requiring players to use special pre-made decks, adding random cards or minions, or changing the
              very rules of ability activation or mana use.
            </li>
            <li>Adventure mode is a single-player game mode in which the player does battle against special
              computer-controlled bosses, featuring unique hero powers and special cards. Beating these bosses reward
              the player with cards that cannot be obtained elsewhere as well as unique card backs.
            </li>
            <li>Players can also choose to issue a Friendly Challenge to a player on their friends list. These unranked
              matches offer few rewards, save the satisfaction of crushing your friends in combat.
            </li>
            <li>Spectator mode is an observational mode that allows the player to spectate a match being undertaken by
              one or two other players. The spectator can see the player's cards and all minions, and can mouse over all
              interface elements as if in control of the game. However, Spectator mode is purely observational and does
              not allow the player to affect the match in progress.

          <h2>Game Formats</h2>
          <p>Game formats present two distinct ways to play Hearthstone: Standard, and Wild.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Standard format is the more balanced and competitive format, and the intended focus for newer players.
              Aiming to present a fresher and more focused experience, Standard format matches allow only cards from
              card sets released in the current or previous calendar year, as well as the Basic and Classic sets.
              Standard format is the default game mode for Play mode and the Arena.
            </li>
            <li>Wild format presents an unrestricted playing experience without the deck restrictions of Standard
              format, allowing the use of cards from any card set. It is the default game mode for adventures and almost
              all Tavern Brawls. However, the format is not unlocked for Play mode until the player has obtained at
              least one card exclusive to Wild format.

          <h2>Quests</h2>
          <p>Quests are special objectives players can complete to earn gold, and occasionally special cards. Quests
            feature criteria such as winning games with a certain class, dealing a certain amount of damage to enemy
            heroes, or casting a certain number of spells. Players are awarded a new daily quest each day, up to a
            maximum of three current quests. Quests are the main way for players to earn gold.</p>

        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Matchmaking</h2>
          <p>Matches played in Play mode and the Arena use a matchmaking system to determine pairings. Each player has a
            matchmaking rating, based upon the player's history of games played against other players. In Casual Play
            mode and the Arena, new players are placed in a special pool with other new players for their first few
            matches, to ease the transition into the game. The matchmaking process aims to ensure that players face
            opponents of a similar skill level.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="tutorial-section">
        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Disconnection And Reconnection</h2>
          <p>If a player is disconnected from Battle.net during a game of Hearthstone, the system will give the player
            60 seconds to reconnect to the game, in which case they will immediately be returned to the match they were
            playing.[6] However, the game will not be paused during disconnections, meaning that returning players may
            find their turn has expired or the state of the battle has progressed in their absence. Disconnections
            during the finding opponent process generally cause the queue to be suspended until both players are
            connected.</p>
          <p>If the player is not able to reconnect to the game in time, the game will be concluded in favour of the
            remaining player. If both players end up disconnected, the game will end in a tie. Players who are unable to
            reconnect to the game will be informed of the outcome when they log back in.</p>
          <p>Disconnection during matches can result in consequences such as experience, gold and Ranked mode stars
            failing to display at the end of the match. However, although not displayed these are correctly applied, and
            can be seen in other interface elements such as the Play screen rank indicator and the Quest Log.</p>
          <p>There is also an automatic reconnect feature which was added in an Unknown Patch. If an animation takes
            longer than 10 seconds, it gets tracked by the game client and if it reaches 25 seconds, the client will
            automatically try to reconnect you back into your game (all stuck animations should be cleared after the
            reconnect).</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="tutorial-section">
        <div class="tutorial-text">
          <h2>Social</h2>
          <p>Unlike most games, Hearthstone does not have a traditional chat-box. Rather, you can right-click on your
            character and select specific emotes, such as a verbal taunt, a welcome, well played, or other chat options.
            Players can also choose to right-click on their opponent to "squelch" them, preventing their emotes from
            showing. There is also a friends chat function, which allows players on RealID and BattleTag friends lists
            to talk, regardless of whether they are playing Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Diablo III or StarCraft II,
            or simply have the Battle.net launcher open.</p>
          <p>Blizzard have stated that their decision to restrict (non-friends list) opponent communication to simple
            emotes, rather than allowing a full chat function, was in order to reduce potential for harassment, making
            the game more accessible, and to keep the game flowing at a quicker pace since no one is stopping to
            type.</p>
          <h3>Finding Opponents</h3>
          <p>Each player's friends list also displays the BattleTag of the last person they played against, provided
            they were not a Real ID or BattleTag friend. This allows players who enjoyed their last matching to add
            their opponent as a friend for future play, or chat.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Players Near Me feature allows players to see other players on the same subnet in their
            friends list, allowing them to challenge local players to battle. Players who are already on the player's
            friends list will not be shown in the Players Near Me section even if they are on the same subnet. The
            feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled in the Options menu.</p>
          <h3>Toasts</h3>
          <p>When a player completes certain actions, such as opening a legendary card, levelling a hero or finishing an
            arena run, a 'toast' will be displayed to all players on their friends list announcing their
            achievement.</p>
          <h3>Fireside Gatherings</h3>
          <p>Fireside Gatherings are real-world gatherings of people to play Hearthstone. They are intended to be an
            opportunity for Hearthstone players to meet, mingle, and form real-life friendships, as well as enjoying
            playing the game face-to-face with some new opponents in either casual play or in tournaments.</p>
          <p>Gatherings can be of any size, and may feature multiple player pools (such as a "novice pool" and an
            "expert pool") or even mini-tournaments, but are intended to be open to players of all skill levels. With
            suggested locations of coffee shops, book stores and college dorms, Fireside Gatherings are mostly intended
            for users of iPads and laptops, although any computer on the same network could be considered part of the
            event.</p>
          <p>Players are actively encouraged to plan and host their own gatherings. For a list of current events, and
            resources for hosting gatherings, see Fireside Gathering.</p>

          <h2>Global Play</h2>
          <p>Global Play allows players to connect to game servers in regions outside their own, making it easy to play
            with friends living in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>Hearthstone is divided into four geographical regions: Americas, Europe, Asia, and China. Each player by
            default uses their Battle.net account home region, but can choose to play Hearthstone in other regions if
            they wish. However, players from the Americas, Europe, and Asia regions are currently unable to select the
            China region for play, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>Players can choose a region to play in through the Battle.net launcher, by selecting an option from the
            drop-down list above the 'Play' button, before launching the game itself. However, players' card collections
            and game progress are unique to each region, and it is not possible to transfer cards to other regions,
            meaning that players wishing to try a new region will have to start building a new collection from scratch
            for that region.</p>
          <p>In global tournaments, such as the Hearthstone Championship Tour and the Hearthstone Global Games,
            countries are officially assigned to one of the four regions. Competitors representing that country are
            assigned to that region, unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <h2>Hearthstone Etiquette</h2>
          <p>In an exciting game full of surging battle, the explosive destruction of the enemy, and the jeers and
            cheers of the audience, it's hardly surprising that Hearthstone can bring out less than polite behavior in
            some players. But what exactly comprises correct or incorrect behavior, and who makes the rules? Hearthstone
            etiquette explains some of the basic sources of contention and debate within the Hearthstone community
            regarding player etiquette.</p>

          <h2>Advanced Rulebook</h2>
          <p>While most rules in Hearthstone are fairly easy to ascertain, when several effects, each with their own
            behaviours, are brought into conflict, things can get a little more complicated. The unofficial Advanced
            rulebook offers a comprehensive explanation of the game's underlying processes, complete with examples and
            video references.</p>

            <li>The "Job's done" soundbite heard when the player is unable to taken any further actions that turn is
              taken from Warcraft III. The soundbite is used by the Alliance Peasant unit upon completion of a task such
              as constructing a building, serving to remind the player to assign the Peasant a new task.
